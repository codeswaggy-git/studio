import { auth } from "@/lib/firebase"; // Assuming firebase admin is not set up for server, this uses client SDK for user check
import type { User } from "firebase/auth";

// This function is a placeholder for how you might get a user in server components/actions.
// For true server-side auth, you'd typically use Firebase Admin SDK and verify ID tokens.
// For simplicity in this Next.js App Router context with client-side Firebase Auth,
// this utility will rely on the client sending user information or an ID token
// which would then be verified server-side.
// However, since Genkit flows are server actions and can't directly access client-side auth state easily,
// we'll simulate this. A proper implementation would involve passing the ID token.

// For the purpose of this example, and assuming server actions can somehow access a session:
// This is a simplified mock. In a real app, this would involve verifying an ID token.
export async function getCurrentUser(): Promise<User | null> {
  // This is a client-side way to get user. Server Actions cannot directly use this.
  // return auth.currentUser;

  // In a real Server Action, you'd typically get the user from a session
  // or by verifying an ID token passed from the client.
  // For this exercise, we'll assume if the action is called, the user is 'simulated'
  // or the client would pass user.uid.
  // A proper solution would involve next-auth or similar for session management,
  // or passing Firebase ID token to server actions for verification.
  
  // Firebase Admin SDK alternative (if running in a trusted server environment):
  // import {getAuth as getAdminAuth} from "firebase-admin/auth";
  // const adminAuth = getAdminAuth();
  // const decodedToken = await adminAuth.verifyIdToken(idTokenFromClient);
  // return await adminAuth.getUser(decodedToken.uid);

  // Given the constraints and existing firebase.ts (client SDK),
  // we'll acknowledge this is a simplification.
  // A true server-side check requires more setup (Firebase Admin, ID token handling).
  // If auth.currentUser is accessible in the server action's context (unlikely without specific setup), it could be used.
  // Let's return a promise that resolves to auth.currentUser to match `User | null` type for now.
  // This will likely be null in a pure server action without additional context.
  // The client will need to ensure user is authenticated before calling.

  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    const unsubscribe = auth.onAuthStateChanged(user => {
      unsubscribe();
      resolve(user);
    }, error => {
      console.error("Error getting current user in auth-utils:", error);
      resolve(null);
    });
  });
